# Data Types
In programming, data types define the types of values that variables can hold. They specify the nature of the data and the operations that can be performed on that data. 

Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data.

Mainly there are two data type subsets: _**Scalar**_ and _**Compound**_

Keep in mind that Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it

## Scalar Types
A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: **integers**, **floating-point numbers**, **Booleans**, and **characters**.

### Integer Types
An integer is a number without a fractional component.

```Rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 2; // i32

    let y: i64 = 8967; // f32
}
```

Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size. Signed and unsigned refer to whether it‚Äôs possible for the number to be negative‚Äîin other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned). 

| Length | Signed | Unsigned |
|---------|-------|----------|
| 8-bit   | i8    | u8   
| 16-bit  | i16   | u16  
| 32-bit  | i32	  | u32
| 64-bit  | i64	  | u64
| 128-bit | i128  | u128
| arch	  | isize | usize

It‚Äôs like writing numbers on paper: when the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign; however, when it‚Äôs safe to assume the number is positive, it‚Äôs shown with no sign.

Signed numbers are stored using two‚Äôs complement representation.

Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2n - 1) to 2n - 1 - 1 inclusive, where n is the number of bits that variant uses. So an i8 can store numbers from -(27) to 27 - 1, which equals -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2n - 1, so a u8 can store numbers from 0 to 28 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

Additionally, the isize and usize types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on, which is denoted in the table as ‚Äúarch‚Äù: 64 bits if you‚Äôre on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you‚Äôre on a 32-bit architecture.

You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown here.

| Number literals | Example       |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Decimal         | 98_222        |
| Hex             | 0xff          |
| Octal           | 0o77          |
| Binary          | 0b1111_0000   |
| Byte (u8 only)  | b'A'          |

Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as 57u8, to designate the type. Number literals can also use _ as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as 1_000, which will have the same value as if you had specified 1000.

So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you‚Äôre unsure, Rust‚Äôs defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to i32. The primary situation in which you‚Äôd use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.

#### Integer Overflow
Let‚Äôs say you have a variable of type u8 that can hold values between 0 and 255. If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, such as 256, integer overflow will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors. When you‚Äôre compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow that cause your program to panic at runtime if this behavior occurs. 

When you‚Äôre compiling in release mode with the --release flag, Rust does not include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if overflow occurs, Rust performs two‚Äôs complement wrapping. In short, values greater than the maximum value the type can hold ‚Äúwrap around‚Äù to the minimum of the values the type can hold. In the case of a u8, the value 256 becomes 0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won‚Äôt panic, but the variable will have a value that probably isn‚Äôt what you were expecting it to have. Relying on integer overflow‚Äôs wrapping behavior is considered an error.

To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:

* Wrap in all modes with the wrapping_* methods, such as wrapping_add.
* Return the None value if there is overflow with the checked_* methods.
* Return the value and a boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the overflowing_* methods.
* Saturate at the value‚Äôs minimum or maximum values with the saturating_* methods.

### Floating-Point Types
Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rust‚Äôs floating-point types are f32 and f64, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively

The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs, it‚Äôs roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision.

All floating-point types are signed.

```Rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```
Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard. The f32 type is a single-precision float, and f64 has double precision.

### The Boolean Type
As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: true and false. Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using bool.

```Rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```
The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an if expression.

### The Character Type
Rust‚Äôs char type is the language‚Äôs most primitive alphabetic type.

```Rust
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = '‚Ñ§'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'üòª';
}
```
Note that we specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.
 
Rust‚Äôs char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust.

Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive. However, a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for what a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù is may not match up with what a char is in Rust.

## Compound Types
Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

### The Tuple Type
A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple don‚Äôt have to be the same.

```Rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

The variable tup binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:

```Rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable tup. It then uses a pattern with let to take tup and turn it into three separate variables, x, y, and z. This is called destructuring because it breaks the single tuple into three parts. 

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access.

```Rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```
This program creates the tuple x and then accesses each element of the tuple using their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first index in a tuple is 0.

The tuple without any values has a special name, unit. This value and its corresponding type are both written () and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don‚Äôt return any other value.

### The Array Type
Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an array. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square brackets:

```Rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements.

An array isn‚Äôt as flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that is allowed to grow or shrink in size.

If you‚Äôre unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chances are you should use a vector. 

However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change. For example, if you were using the names of the month in a program, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know it will always contain 12 elements

```Rust
let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
```

You write an array‚Äôs type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:

```Rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
//Here, i32 is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number 5 indicates the array contains five elements.
```
You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here:
```Rust
let a = [3; 5];
// The array named a will contain 5 elements that will all be set to the value 3 initially. This is the same as writing let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]; but in a more concise way.
```

An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing, like this:

```Rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
// the variable named first will get the value 1 because that is the value at index [0] in the array. The variable named second will get the value 2 from index [1] in the array.
```

Let‚Äôs see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is past the end of the array. The program results in a runtime error at the point of using an invalid value in the indexing operation.

When you attempt to access an element using indexing, Rust will check that the index you‚Äôve specified is less than the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length, Rust will panic.

This is an example of Rust‚Äôs memory safety principles in action. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against this kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory access and continuing.
