# Operators
Operators in programming are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or more operands to produce a result. These operations can include arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, and more. 

## Arithmetic Operators
1. `+` (addition)
2. `-` (subtraction)
3. `*` (multiplication)
4. `/` (division)
5. `%` (modulo, remainder after division)
6. `**` (exponentiation)

## Assignment Operators
1. `=` (assignment)
2. `+=` (add and assign)
3. `-=` (subtract and assign)
4. `*=` (multiply and assign)
5. `/=` (divide and assign)
6. `%=` (modulo and assign)

## Comparison Operators
1. `==` (equal to)
2. `!=` (not equal to)
3. `<` (less than)
4. `>` (greater than)
5. `<=` (less than or equal to)
6. `>=` (greater than or equal to)

## Logical Operators
1. `and - &&` (logical AND)
2. `or - ||` (logical OR)
3. `not - !` (logical NOT)

## Bitwise Operators
1. `&` (bitwise AND)
2. `|` (bitwise OR)
3. `^` (bitwise XOR)
4. `~` (bitwise NOT)
5. `<<` (left shift)
6. `>>` (right shift)
